# Learning Neural OPF Policies with Supervised and Reinforcement Learning

This project explores how deep learning algorithms can be used to learn
decision-making policies for power system operation.

We combine **supervised learning** and **reinforcement learning (RL)**
to train neural networks that approximate optimal power flow (OPF)
solutions and enable fast control-oriented inference.

## Project Overview

The project is organized into two learning stages:

### 1. Supervised Learning (Pretraining)

- A neural network is trained to **imitate OPF solutions**
- Inputs: bus-level active and reactive load demands
- Outputs: optimal voltage magnitudes and phase angles
- Labels are generated by solving OPF using a physics-based solver

This stage provides a strong initialization for downstream control tasks.

### 2. Reinforcement Learning (Policy Learning)

- The pretrained model can be integrated into an RL environment
- The agent interacts with a simulated power grid
- Rewards are designed based on operational cost and constraint violations
- The learned policy enables fast decision-making without solving OPF online

---

## Learning Paradigm

- **Supervised Learning**: learning from optimal OPF demonstrations
- **Reinforcement Learning**: optimizing long-term operational rewards
- **Neural Networks**: fully connected architectures with constrained outputs

This hybrid learning strategy combines the stability of supervised learning
with the flexibility of reinforcement learning.
